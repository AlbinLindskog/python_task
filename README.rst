Your task is to write a python script that can merge multiple xml-documents following the same xsd into one.
The documents you are working with are arbetsgivardeklarationer that have been generated by separate systems and need
to be combined into one before being sent to Skatteverket.

To your help you have two arbetsgivardeklarationer, ´AGI_2021_08-943´ and ´AGI_2021_08-3616´ and the XSD-file used to
generated them. You should be able to infer the correct behaviour when merging the two files from the examples and the
schema. Note that one recipient has entries in both files.

Spend as much or as little time as you would like, just take a note of how much time you did spend, as we will take
that into consideration when assessing your solution.

Good luck!
