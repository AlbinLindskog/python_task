Your task is to write a python script that can merge multiple xml-documents following the same xsd into one.
The documents you are working with are arbetsgivardeklarationer that have been generated by separate systems and need
to be combined into one before being sent to Skatteverket.

To your help you have two arbetsgivardeklarationer, ´AGI_2021_08-943´ and ´AGI_2021_08-3616´. These are simplified and
you should be able to infer the
from which the ".

Note that one recipient has entries in both files.


Spend as much or as little time as you would like, just take a note of how much time you did spend, as we will take
that into consideration when assessing your solution.

Good luck!
